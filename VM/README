== CS 4120 VM ==================================================================

We provide this virtual machine to avoid cross-plattform issues. It comes
with Java 8, Scala, (Ant, Maven), JFlex, OCaml (Opam, Oasis), and Python 2/3
preinstalled.

Note that the folder 'shared' is mounted at the path '~/shared' in the VM to
facilitate easy sharing of project files. You can do all editing etc on your
physical machine and use the virtual machine only for building & running your
application.

To get started, refer to the INSTALL file.
