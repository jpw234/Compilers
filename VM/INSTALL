== INSTALL  ====================================================================

(1) Install VirtualBox _and_ VirtualBox Extension Pack: 
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

(2) Install Vagrant:
    * Windows, OS X: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
    * Ubuntu: apt-get install vagrant

(2.5) Under Windows, you may have to reboot...

(3) Make sure you are connected to the Internet, preferably via a fast
    connection. Run 'vagrant up && vagrant ssh'.
    Go get coffee...
    (Don't worry, only the first start takes so long. Ignore the worrisome
    looking red messages; unless vagrant terminates with an error, everything
    is okay.)

(4) You are now accessing the VM via ssh. 
    To look around, run 'ls -l'. (Note the shared folder.)
    To exit, run 'exit'.

(5) To halt the VM, run 'vagrant halt'.
    To spin it back up, run 'vagrant up && vagrant ssh' again.
    To remove the VM, run 'vagrant destroy'.

(6) The folder ./shared on your host machine is accessible from the virtual
    machine at ~/shared. You can do all editing etc on your physical machine and
    use the virtual machine only for building & running your application.
