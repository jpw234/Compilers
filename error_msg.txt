SYNOPSIS
xic [--lex] [--help] [-p path] [file ...]
DESCRIPTION
Compile programming code. Transfer input string into a set of tokens.
--help: A synopsis of options lists all possible options along with brief descriptions.
--lex: Generate output from lexical analysis. For each source file named filename.xi,
an output file named filename.lexed is generated to provide the result of lexing
the source file.
-p setting the file path of the xi files to be compiled
